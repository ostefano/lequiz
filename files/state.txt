Why?\",\"a\":\"Encrypt-then-MAC is the most ideal scenario. Any modifications to the ciphertext that do not also have a valid MAC code can be filtered out before decryption, protecting against any attacks on the implementation. The MAC cannot, also, be used to infer anything about the plaintext. MAC-then-Encrypt and Encrypt-and-MAC both provide different levels of security, but not the complete set provided by Encrypt-then-MAC.\"},{\"id\":\"3\",\"class\":\"malware\",\"level\":\"100\",\"attempted\":false,\"q\":\"What is a <strong>metamorphic<\/strong> malware?\",\"a\":[\"F:A combination of both\",\"F:Metamorphic malware does not exist\",\"F:Malware that rewrite its data-structures to avoid detection\",\"T:Malware that rewrite all its code to avoid detection\"]},{\"id\":\"4\",\"class\":\"malware\",\"level\":\"500\",\"attempted\":false,\"q\":\"In principle, is metamorphic malware more powerful than polymorphic ones?

ASLR involves randomly arranging the positions of key data areas of a program, including the base of the executable and the positions of the stack, heap, and libraries, in a process's address space. In some architectures (e.g., 32-bit) there are a limited number of randomizations, making the technique vulnerable to brute-force attacks.\"},{\"id\":\"8\",\"class\":\"misc\",\"level\":\"200\",\"attempted\":false,\"q\":\"What algorithm is best if we need to hash passwords?\",\"a\":[\"T:MD5\",\"F:SHA-512\",\"F:SHA-3 (Keccak)\",\"F:PBKDF2\",\"F:SHA-224\"]},{\"id\":\"9\",\"class\":\"appsec\",\"level\":\"400\",\"attempted\":false,\"q\":\"What is SALTing and what attack does it prevent?\",\"a\":\"It is the usage of an additional input to a one-way to a one-way function that hashes a password or passphrase.

But if you\u2019re already using AES-256, there\u2019s no reason to change.\\\" Why is that?\",\"a\":\"AES does multiple rounds of transforming each chunk of data, and it uses different portions of the key in these different rounds. The specification for which portions of the key get used when is called the key schedule. The key schedule for 256-bit keys is not as well designed as the key schedule for 128-bit keys. And in recent years there has been substantial progress in turning those design problems into potential attacks on AES 256.\"}]","teams":"[{\"id\":1,\"name\":\"Team 1\",\"score\":0},{\"id\":2,\"name\":\"Team 2\",\"score\":0},{\"id\":3,\"name\":\"Team 3\",\"score\":0},{\"id\":4,\"name\":\"Team 4\",\"score\":0}]"}
